Career Guidance System

In current day scenario, the rate of unemployment is increasing drastically. We believe that this is due to the fact that the students are not really familiar with the current trends in technologies which might impact their skill-set which in-turn leads to lack of professional skills making them unemployed or procuring lesser salaries. This is what our idea will exploit.
We are building a system that provides guidance to students in making their career choices based on the skills they possess.
We came up with a machine learning model implemented using various algorithms. We used data preprocessing and visualization techniques and determined the accuracies given by various algorithms and picked the one that gave us best predictions.

Specifications:
	Programming Language used: Python Programming
	Platform used: Google Colab
	ML algorithms used: Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine and Xg boost
	Python libraries used: Pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn
